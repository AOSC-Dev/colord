Version 0.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2011-01-26

 - A small break in the DBus API this release: Commit() has been added.
 - Many new properties are available on the interfaces.
 - SANE and v4linux UDEV devices are now added as colord devices.

   get auto-assigned when they appear.

 - Save 'disk' scope devices to a system-wide database (Richard Hughes)
 - Track per-system profile stores (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Actually emit the CdClient::DeviceAdded signal (Richard Hughes)

 - Don't print a blank line in colormgr if there is no qualifier (Richard Hughes)
 - Make DeleteDevice take an ID, not an object (Richard Hughes)
 - Make PolicyKit support optional to fix the build on Windows (Richard Hughes)
 - Profiles do not have a created property, so don't try to display one (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2011-01-13

Notes:
 - Colord is a simple system activated daemon that maps devices to color
   profiles.
 - It is used by gnome-color-manager for CUPS integration and is also
   used when there are no users logged in.
 - The only real user at the moment is CUPS, but GNOME Color Manager
   will start depending on colord when it is included in most mainstream
   distributions.
 - The DBus interface is not set in stone, and the libcolord library
   will have new API added to it as required. If colord needs to break
   public API at this stage for a specific use case, it will.
 - The persistent storage code is not written yet, but that will come
   with the next colord version.

New Features:
 - Add a 'Kind' attribute to the device objects (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a libcolord shared library that can be used in the client tools (Richard Hughes)
 - Add an example spec file (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple colormgr man page (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple GTK test GUI for testing the DBus interfaces (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple script to create a test device (Richard Hughes)
 - Add basic DBus interface (Richard Hughes)
 - Add code for the DeleteDevice method (Richard Hughes)
 - Add DeleteProfile() on the main interface (Richard Hughes)
 - Add GetProfileForQualifier() code (Richard Hughes)
 - Add MakeProfileDefault() implementation to CdDevice (Richard Hughes)
 - Add qualifiers to profiles (Richard Hughes)
 - Allow clients to set properties on the objects using SetProperty (Richard Hughes)
 - Expose the device created time (Richard Hughes)
 - Fixed typo in ColorManager API description (Tim Waugh)
 - Open the profile using lcms2 after we set the profile filename (Richard Hughes)
 - Provide a method to assign an ICC profile to a profile object (Richard Hughes)
 - Provide methods for mapping the device ID to the object path (Richard Hughes)
 - Use seporate PolicyKit authorisations for each action type (Richard Hughes)
