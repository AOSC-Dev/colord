What colord does:

* Provides a DBus API for system frameworks to query, e.g.
  "Get me the profiles for device $foo" or
  "Create a device and assign it profile $bar"

* Provides a persistant key-file backed store that is preserved accross
  reboots.

* Provides the session for a way to set system settings, for instance
  setting the display profile for all users and all sessions.

colord also provides a debugging utility tool called colormgr that
allows the end user to add, remove and assign color devices.
