<h2>Mapping the device to the profile</h2>

<p>
Preferences are per-user and are stored in GConf in GNOME 2-30, or GSettings in newer versions.
There is need for configuration of devices to profiles, and to store metadata about each device.
This is stored in the colord mapping database, which is
<code>/var/lib/colord/mapping.db</code> by default.
The schema is really simple, and as follows:
</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE mappings (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,device TEXT,profile TEXT);
</pre>

<p>
Multiple profiles can of course be assigned to the same device.
Persistent devices and profiles can also be saved to the storage database, which is
<code>/var/lib/colord/storage.db</code> by default.
The schema is really simple, and as follows:
</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE devices (device_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,device TEXT);
CREATE TABLE properties (device_id TEXT,property TEXT,value TEXT);
</pre>

<h2>Setting the system default</h2>
<p>
One user may want to set the default for all users.
We cannot reference files in <code>/home/foo/.icc/</code> when logged in
as user bar, as the user will not have access permissions, or in the
worst case, <code>/home/foo</code> may be encrypted and inaccessible even as root.
For this reason, colord copies the ICC profiles to a system-wide directory,
<code>/usr/lib/color</code> that is per-machine and accessible to all users.
</p>

<p>
It is <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openicc/2010q2/002167.html">encouraged</a> that other CMS implementations also read ICC profiles from the per-machine
<code>/usr/lib/color</code> directory.
</p>

<h1>GNOME Color Manager</h1>

<p>
GNOME Color Manager is a session framework that makes it easy to manage, install and generate color profiles in the GNOME desktop.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep integration into GNOME and GTK+.</li>
<li>Official inclusion as core module since GNOME 2.32.</li>
<li>36 official translations.</li>
<li>Shipped by all of the big distributions already.</li>
<li>Allows per-user and per-system configuration and defaults.</li>
<li>Supports the ICC Profiles in X specification.</li>
<li>Uses <a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/">ArgyllCMS</a>, so huge number of calibration devices supported.</li>
<li>Supports the Huey device as a native device which does not use the ArgyllCMS driver</li>
<li>GPLv2+ licence which makes it Free Software.</li>
<li>Provides a simple to use cross-platform <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-color-manager/plain/src/org.gnome.ColorManager.xml">D-Bus interface</a> for applications to use.</li>
<li>Used by <a href="https://launchpad.net/simple-scan">simple scan</a> for calibration data.</li>
<li>Used by gnome-screenshot for the window ICC profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>
GNOME Color Manager is a ''thin solution'' where it defers to the application the pixbuf transforming (using something like <a href="http://www.littlecms.com/">lcms</a>, or <a href="http://cairographics.org/">cairo</a>) and only providing a <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gnome-color-manager/screenshots.html">simple UI</a> and minimalist D-Bus interface for interested applications to query.
</p>

<h2>What the binaries do</h2>

<p>
GCM ships quite a few data files and binary files. Most users will interact with ICC files by double clicking on them, and with color management using ''System->Preferences->Color Profiles''. It's not expected that users should need to run any command line programs at all.
</p>

For interest, the different binaries are listed here.

<h3>GTK programs</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>gcm-prefs</code> - The main preferences dialog used to map profiles to devices.</li>
<li><code>gcm-import</code> - Helper to import an ICC file. This is normally run by the <code>gcm-import.desktop</code> file.</li>
<li><code>gcm-picker</code> - Simple program to pick a spot color using a photospectrometer or colorimeter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Command line tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>gcm-inspect</code> - Command line tool to inspect the
<a href="http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=ICC_Profiles_in_X_Specification_0.4"><code>_ICC_PROFILE</code></a>
atoms and test the D-Bus API.</li>
<li><code>gcm-fix-profile</code> - Tries to fix a corrupted or invalid ICC profile file.</li>
<li><code>gcm-session</code> - D-Bus session service that is started on demand.</li>
<li><code>gcm-dump-edid</code> - Debugging program that dumps the EDID to a file.</li>
<li><code>gcm-dump-profile</code> - Debugging program that dumps all details about a profile.</li>
</ul>

<h1>General points:</h1>

<p>
I think most of the CMM functionality can be (and should be) integrated
into the platform, e.g. <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> and Cairo.
</p>
<p>
It's my opinion that it's best to have two different applications for
something that share a common specification, rather than trying to be
a jack-of-all-trades.
It's a clich√©, but KDE users do want options, and GNOME users do want
things to 'just work'.
You can't design a library, or even an application for those different
user types.
This is why I developed <b>GNOME</b> Color Manager, not ColorManager.
</p>
<p>
I do think the concept of a <i>monolithic CMS</i> is flawed.
Color management has to be integral to the stack, so Xorg, GTK, Cairo,
etc. all have to play their part.
You can't really push a monolithic library when you need to interface
with so many parts of the stack.
I see GCM as a the cherry on colord, with all the heavy lifting being
done by cairo, lcms and <a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/">ArgyllCMS</a>.
GCM just provides the configuration widgets in the session and makes the
data available to applications.
