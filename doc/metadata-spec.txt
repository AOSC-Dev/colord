= Introduction =

This document will explain the metadata keys used by GNOME Color Manager
and colord in the hope that other CMS solutions will hopefully
interoperate with this specification.

The specific metadata is usually added to the colord devices and
profiles for the CMS internal use, and to aid the automatic matching of
devices to profiles.

== Profile Metadata ==

EDID_md5		the EDID md5 checksum
EDID_model		the EDID monitor name
EDID_serial		the EDID serial number
EDID_mnft		the EDID PNP ID
EDID_manufacturer	the EDID vendor name
FILE_checksum		the FILE checksum

Projects already using this format:
 * GNOME Color Manager

== Device Metadata ==

XRANDR_name		the XRandR name, e.g. "lvds1"
